# File Operation 
```
In order to acess file we have a built in operator called open in python.

When u try to run this make sure u change the location of the file accordingly
```
> This Open function as 3 modes of operation
## 1. [open in Read mode](https://github.com/abhishekpshenoy/Python/blob/main/fileoperation/readMode.py)
```
    We can just read a file with different manner but we can't write anything to the file or modify the file in the mode

```
## 2. [open in write mode](https://github.com/abhishekpshenoy/Python/blob/main/fileoperation/writeMode.py)
```
    In order to write anything into a new file we can use it in write mode but one disadvantage is this mode will delete the previous data presin the file
```
## 3. [open with append mode](https://github.com/abhishekpshenoy/Python/blob/main//fileoperation/appendMode.py)
# This is the end of Conditional Statements
```
    This mode will open a file with append mode that is the new data will be entred after the last entry it will not even give a white space in between
```
