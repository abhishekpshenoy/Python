# Bitwise operators: Bitwise operator acts on bits and performs bit by bit operation

a = 10
b = 4
   
# Print bitwise AND operation   
print(a & b) 
   
# Print bitwise OR operation 
print(a | b) 
   
# Print bitwise NOT operation  
print(~a) 
   
# print bitwise XOR operation  
print(a ^ b) 
   
# print bitwise right shift operation  
print(a >> 2) 
   
# print bitwise left shift operation  
print(a << 2)
