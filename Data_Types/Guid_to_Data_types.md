# Data Types
```
Data Types are the classification or categorization of data items.
It represents the kind of value that tells what operations can be performed on a particular data.
Since everything is an object in Python programming, data types are actually classes and variables are instance (object) of these classes.
```

### String
```
A string is a collection of one or more characters put in a single quote, double-quote or triple quote.
In python there is no character data type, a character is a string of length one. It is represented by str class.
Strings in Python can be created using single quotes or double quotes or even triple quotes.
```

> Concepts
1. Creation of String
2. Accessing of String
3. Deleting/Updating from a String

### Detail code is provided in ![Here](https://github.com/abhishekpshenoy/Python/blob/main/Data_Types/String.py)
### List
```
Lists are just like the arrays, declared in other languages.
A single list may contain DataTypes like Integers, Strings, as well as Objects. The elements in a list are indexed according to a definite sequence and the indexing of a list is done with 0 being the first index.
It is represented by list class.
```
> Concepts
1. Creation of List
2. Adding Elements to a List
3. Accessing elements from the List
4. Removing Elements from the List

### Detail code is provided in ![Here](https://github.com/abhishekpshenoy/Python/blob/main/Data_Types/Lists.py)
### Tuple
```
Tuple is an ordered collection of Python objects much like a list.
The important difference between a list and a tuple is that tuples are immutable.
It is represented by tuple class.
In Python, tuples are created by placing a sequence of values separated by ‘comma’ with or without the use of parentheses for grouping of the data sequence.
```
> Concepts
1. Creating an tuple
2. Accessimg elements from tuple
3. Updation / Deletion  elements from tuple

### Detail code is provided in ![Here](https://github.com/abhishekpshenoy/Python/blob/main/Data_Types/Tuple.py)
### Boolean
```
Booleans are data type with one of the two built-in values, True or False.
It is denoted by the class bool.
```
### Detail code is provided in ![Here](https://github.com/abhishekpshenoy/Python/blob/main/Data_Types/Boolean.py)
### Set
```
Set is an unordered collection of data type that is iterable, mutable and has no duplicate elements.
The order of elements in a set is undefined though it may consist of various elements.
Sets can be created by using the built-in set() function with an iterable object or a sequence by placing the sequence inside curly braces {}, separated by ‘comma’.
```
> Concepts
1. Creating a Set
2. Addition of elements in a Set
3. Accessing of elements in a set
4. Deletion of elements in a Set
### Detail code is provided in ![Here](https://github.com/abhishekpshenoy/Python/blob/main/Data_Types/Set.py)

### Dictionary
```
Dictionary in Python is an unordered collection of data values, used to store data values like a map.
Dictionary holds key:value pair.
Each key-value pair in a Dictionary is separated by a colon :, whereas each key is separated by a ‘comma’.
A Dictionary can be created by placing a sequence of elements within curly {} braces, separated by ‘comma’.
```
> Concepts
1. Different types of Declaration of Dictionary 
2. Adding elements to a Dictionary
3. Accessing elements from a Dictionary
4. Removing Elements from Dictionary
5. Nested Dictionary
